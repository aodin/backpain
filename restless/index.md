A REST-less Introduction to Backbone.js
=======================================

Has your AJAX code gone to hell? Is your code so intertwined that it makes the [Gordian Knot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot) jealous?

Try giving it a [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/).

This tutorial assumes a working knowledge of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS), and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). No [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) backend is used. It is written in plain javascript instead of [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) to reduce the prerequisites.
